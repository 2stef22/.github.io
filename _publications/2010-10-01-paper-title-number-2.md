title: "Exploring the Security Culture of Operational Technology (OT) Organisations: the Role of External Consultancy in Overcoming Organisational Barriers"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2010-10-01-paper-title-number-2
excerpt: 'In this paper, we have conducted 33 interviews with professionals with an OT security related role. Our analysis indicates three key organisational barriers to the development of a security culture: governance structures, lack of communication between functions, and the lack of OT cybersecurity expertise. Subsequently, the role of consultants and security solution vendors in overcoming these barriers through consultancy is demonstrated.'
