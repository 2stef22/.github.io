I am a PhD Candidate in organisational cybersecurity at University College London (UCL), with a background
in computer science, supervised by [Prof. Jeremy Watson](https://petras-iot.org/person/prof-jeremy-watson/) and [Prof. Steve Hailes](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/about/head-department-professor-steve-hailes).


## Research

My research is centred on the development of security culture in companies that use Operational Technology (OT), such as those in the water, energy, and transport sectors. Through qualitative methods, I have focused on the institutional and organisational factors that affect the development of a security culture. More specifically, I have investigated how external stakeholders (e.g., consultants, regulators, service providers) influence organisational practices, common organisational barriers to OT cybersecurity, the relationship between safety and security cultures, and the key factors that influence operational personnelâ€™s mindsets and interactions with cybersecurity.

## Education

  **MEng in Computer Science**  
  *University College London University - First Class Honours*  
  International Programme with a Year Abroad at the University of Queensland between 2018-2019
  Dissertation supervisor: [Dr. Simone Righi](https://www.simonerighi.com/)


## Personal

I was born and grew up in Nicosia, Cyprus. When I am not painstakingly working on my PhD, I like to spend my time cooking or in the quintessential English institution - the pub.
